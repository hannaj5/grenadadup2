Some of these were collected and are currently viewable online at the British MuseumÕs website (URL below). Looting of the push-piles by the surrounding community was immediate and continues today. The amount and quality of artifacts that left the island inside the luggage of tourists is incalculable. Indeed, the scale of the Pearls site cannot be underestimated. As summarized below, Pearls has been ripped up by airport construction, looted for decades by the surrounding community, mined of large tracks of its soil by the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project, excavated by numerous archaeological projects (thousands of artifacts are in the GNMÕs storageÑeasily 90% of their Amerindian collection), and yet a tourist can still drive up to Pearls today and buy a bag of authentic adornos! Most Saladoid/Barrancoid-era sites yield just a few hundred adornos at most. So the fact that whole bags of these artifacts are still easily acquired after 70 years of devastation is mind-boggling. The size and extent of Pearls is rivalled only by a few big ceremonial sites in Puerto Rico.Given its size, Pearls has received the bulk of archaeological attention in Grenada to date. Ripley BullenÕs survey of the island in 1962 excavated two large (2x3m) units near the Òedge of the runway,Ó probably on the northern side. No map was provided in his report, so the precise location of his excavations is not known. Keegan has mentioned that he was able to locate BullenÕs units during the 1989 field season (personal communication 2015), but no map of his work is known either. From 1988-1991, the Foundation for Field Research led by Thomas Banks and Ann Cody conducted extensive excavations at Pearls, teaming up with the Florida Museum of Natural History (led by Bill Keegan) for the 1989 and 1990 seasons. At least 18 excavation units were opened during this time, but only synthetic summaries are available today. Only a few random excavation forms are on file at the GNM, and no journals, maps, or reports other than those presented here are known. In fact, the only archaeological map of Pearls is that provided in CodyÕs 1986 Inventory Sheet, written prior to any excavations. Thus, we do not have the precise locations of any excavations ever conducted at this site. However, based on contextual clues left in the reports (especially Cody and Keegan 1990), and site visits by Jon Hanna with locals who worked with FFR (esp. Oscar Andall), allowed an approximate map to be devised.Putting aside the mapping oversightsÑand the fact that the only literature on the site are gray reports and conference papersÑ the synthetic work available reveals some rather spectacular observations. The site was clearly a major trading port in prehistory, where beads and pendants of exotic gemstones (e.g., amethyst, pyrite, nephrite, and turquoise), lithic tools, and non-native faunal remains were traded from across northern South AmericaÑ as far south as eastern Brazil, and as far north as Vieques, Puerto Rico (Boomert 1987; Cody 1990, 1991; Fandrich 1990; Hofman et al. 2011; Laffoon et al. 2014; Newsom and Wing 2004). Other notable findings included discoidal shells, a sharkÕs tooth pendant, a jaguar pendant, and a highly decorated assemblage of pottery including many complete bowls and innumerable zoomorphic adornos. Given the quality of the ceramics recovered, noticeably absent from past studies is an adequate analysis of the ceramic assemblage. The Pearls site is concentrated just north of the airstrip, bounded by a hill to the west and coastal marsh to the east. The FFR excavations revealed lithic debris of all manufacturing stages was concentrated towards the north of the site (Units A and B). It was also reported that Unit S164-100 may have revealed an earthen floor, possibly indicating the location of domestic living spaces. A large midden was scattered to the west, tapering off towards FFRÕs western transect. Every excavation unit exhibited varying degrees of disturbance, but this area to the west was believed less disturbed. Aside from the airport disturbance, truckloads of soil were removed from the site during the Cocao Rehabilitation Project from 1987-1989, which effectively created faux archaeological sites across the island (e.g., at Boulogne). A playing field to the west of this area was expanded in the 1990s, into the area believed less disturbed. Studies of the flora (Newsom 1993) and fauna (Lippold 1991, Fandrich 1990a,1990b, Newsom and Wing 2004) were all based on samples from this western transect, particularly the trench excavation W195. Notably, diagnostic pottery from W195 were mostly late types, such as ÒscratchedÓ and Òfinger-indentedÓ styles, of the Suazan Troumassoid period, rather than the Saladoid-era pottery typically associated with the site. A piece of charcoal from this excavation (W195, level 103-113 cmbs) was recently radiocarbon dated between calAD 1160-1260.Indeed, while the pottery styles at Pearls exhibit Saladoid-Barrancoid types, the radiocarbon dates have yet to reveal settlement before AD 385. This date (actually, calAD 385-645), has consistently been misreported as between 100BC-AD100 because when it was first analyzed in 1989, it was not calibrated (Cody 1991). Because the material dated was marine shell, it must be properly calibrated in order to combat the marine reservoir effect, sometimes referred to as Òold waterÓ. Failure to calibrate marine materials will result in dates that are hundreds of years older than the actual date. Thus, re-calibrating the Pearls samples using the global marine curve and a regional Delta-R curve of -19+/- 23, places the earliest settlement period for Pearls squarely in the 4th Century AD. Given the size of the midden, it is not surprising the the occupation spans at least until the 12th Century. A pollen core taken near Meadow Beach-- the swamp just to the east of Pearls-- by Siegel et al. (2015) indicate potential human disturbance (changes in taxa, decline in arboreal species, increase in charcoal) by around 2000BC. No introduced plants or pollen were detected in the core, however, leaving open the possibility that this proxy is more indicative of natural, rather than anthropogenic, changes to the vegetation and climate.Background of the AirportPoint Salines was always considered the best place for an airport in Grenada, but political wrangling in the 1940s led to the DeGale familyÕs sale of land at Pearls (a golf course at the time) to the British government (Martin 2007:187). The Pearls airport opened in 1943, providing a major stimulus to the countryÕs economy, but its insufficiencies were immediately apparent. Only small, regional planes could land, despite an eventual lengthening of the airstrip, and the surrounding mountains prevented not only further expansion but also the ability to land at night. Flights to Grenada were therefore constrained to daylight hours (no night landings) of local flights from Trinidad and Barbados. By at least 1954, the recently empowered Gairy government began acquiring lands at Point Salines from the Julien family (Steele 2003:388) to build a larger international airport that would expand GrenadaÕs tourism industry. GairyÕs main opposition, the New Jewel Movement, criticized GairyÕs plans as bourgeois excess. Yet after the NJM overthrew Gairy in the 1979 coup, these plans became one of their biggest projects and longest-lasting legacy (Martin 2007:194). Since Pearls ceased its airport operations in 1986, the airstrip has functioned as cow pasture, construction dumping ground, and a drag-strip for auto racing. The dilapidated terminal buildings are known as Camp Reynold, which house the Special Forces arm of the Royal Grenada Police Force. The RGPF occasionally conducts weapons and explosives testing in the area. Since the airportÕs closing, various foreign development groups have taken interest, but no plans have been brought to fruition. On May 22, 2015, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Vaughn Aeronautical College, the University of the West Indies and the Government of Grenada, signed a letter of intent to create an aviation school at Pearls. To date (March 2017), nothing has happened.Tourists are routinely brought to Pearls to see the two Revolution-era airplanes next to the RGPF buildings: a Cubana Airlines passenger jet and an Aerflot crop-duster. In the book Operation Urgent Memory (Puri 2014), the decrepit state of these airplanes are used as case examples for GrenadaÕs neglect of its heritage. Amazingly, the author, Shalini Puri, managed to track down a picture of a US soldier standing next to the Aerflot plane, which was in pristine condition at the time (photo attached). Given the tourism traffic at Pearls, the site has enormous potential as an educational landmark for Grenadians and locals alike. From the unprecedented Amerindian site to the plantation-era windmill along the Simon River, to the Revolution-era airplanes, Pearls encapsulates the entire history of Grenada. Its potential for heritage tourism and public education should not be underestimated.","MAJOR REPORTS (Chronological Order):Bullen 1964; Cody and Banks 1988; Keegan and Cody 1990; Cody 1990a; Cody 1991; Keegan 1991; Petitjean Roget et al. 2000DERIVATIVE PAPERS (Alphabetical Order):Bullen 1964, 1965, 1968, 1970; Cody 1990b (SAA), Cody 1993 (1991 IACA); Fandrich 1990a, 1990b; Lippold 1991 (1989 IACA); Newsom 1993; Newsom and Wing 2004; Stokes 1990; Sutty 1991 (1989 IACA)OTHER RELEVANT MENTIONS:Boomert 1987; Fitzpatrick 2010; Hofman et al. 2011; Laffoon et al. 2014; British Museum Artifacts from Grenada: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=grenada&view=listAviation School:http://www.gbn.gd/en/gbnnews/1/1527/Aviation-Academy.htm?ls-art0=15http://www.gbn.gd/en/gbnnews/1/1528/Aviation-Academy-Brainchild.htmhttp://thenewtoday.gd/editorials/2015/05/15/another-pipe-dream/","Aside from artifacts at the British Museum, Bright (2011:77) reports that a collection from Pearls exists in the Vigie Depot, St. Lucia and in the National Museum and Art Gallery in Trinidad"
