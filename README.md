# This is a really cool archaeological database for Grenada!

#THINGS TO DO
#(not in any order)
-add previous/next buttons to site entries (show pages?) for easier navigation 
-add something to the default Dashboard page [I could not figure this one out]
	app/admin/dashboard.rb
-display thumbnail image/map for each site on first table (Index)
	https://activeadmin.info/3-index-pages.html
-change display entries to include line breaks
	-sidebar tables are cut off (e.g., Notes)
	-I think this is in "archeological_sites.rb"
-better sorting of site #s (custom sorting?)
	-might just need to remove the "---" from pseudo-sites
-how to add users? (at least 3 generic users needed)
-how to do massive find/replace for spelling errors (e.g., Grendad, grendada, archeological, etc)
-Add full reference citations (so, when a reference is mentioned, the full reference is available somehow-- perhaps like Wikipedia)
-"Description" should be "location description"
