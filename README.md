# Rails Starter

This is really just here to save a couple steps with using Cloud 9, Rails and Github. I like the Github Licensing and .gitignore and I like the Cloud 9 setup  otherwise. This just combines the two.

# Usage

When starting a new Cloud 9 Rails project, just add ```git@github.com:olendorf/rails_starter.git``` in the **Clone from Git or Mercurial URL ** box.
