<h2>Coming Soon: A Web-database of Archaeological Sites in Grenada!</h2><p>
THINGS TO DO <br>
(not in any order) <br>
<ul>
<li>add previous/next buttons to site entries (show pages?) for easier navigation </li>
<li>add something to the default Dashboard page [I could not figure this one out]
	app/admin/dashboard.rb</li>
<li>display thumbnail image/map for each site on first table (Index)</li>
	https://activeadmin.info/3-index-pages.html
<li>change display entries to include line breaks</li>
	-sidebar tables are cut off (e.g., Notes)
	-I think this is in "archeological_sites.rb"
<li>better sorting of site #s (custom sorting?)</li>
	-might just need to remove the "---" from pseudo-sites
<li>how to add users? (at least 3 generic users needed)v
<li>how to do massive find/replace for spelling errors (e.g., Grendad, grendada, archeological, etc)</li>
<li>Add full reference citations (so, when a reference is mentioned, the full reference is available somehow-- perhaps like Wikipedia)</li>
<li>"Description" should be "location description"</li>
